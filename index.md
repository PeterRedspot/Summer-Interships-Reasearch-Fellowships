Successful applicants will be paired with a graduate student or postdoc mentor and will have the opportunity to conduct research at local childrenâ€™s museums and in the lab, and collaborate on a variety of on-going and new projects. Our lab uses looking time, eye tracking, free play, intervention, and other behavioral methods to investigate inductive learning and statistical inference in social cognition, category learning, physical reasoning, causal learning, word learning, and other domains.
